# VR-Galerie Monnin, Virtual Photos Exhibition from M. Roberto STEPHENSON and Associated Conference Room, January 2019

Created for the Galerie Monnin, following the Haiti Tech Summit, in July 2019.

The idea is to allow the user to immerse himself/herself inside a virtual gallery showcasing the work of renown Haitian artists. This is a typical gallery developed for a Haitian artist.

In VR, using an Oculus Quest head mounted display and both its hand controllers (left and right), the user can:
- Use the thumbstick on the hand controllers to move around the main scene;
- Push the thumbstick down to accelerate the movement (speedx3, for longer distances)
- Use the grip button on the hand controllers to grab/release an object in a cart that follows the user at all times;
- Push the trigger (red laserbeam) on selected game objects to visualize a dashboard of predifined statistics (using an SQLite database structure);
- Use the portals to immediately teleport from one gallery to the other.

Inside the gallery, the user can see 
- Videos applied as textures on virtual movie screens
- Avatars integrated into the virtual gallery.
- Development in progress: network several visitors and allow them to go to a (virtual) conference room to attend real time events

This VR application was designed using Unity 2019.2.9f1.

It was built for the folowing platforms:
- Desktop (Windows 10)
- WebGL original version (visible at: https://patrickattie.itch.io/galerievirtuelle, password = galvir)
- Oculus Quest head mounted display and left and right hand controllers (buttons used: thumbstick, trigger, grip)
